Remove Nth Node From End of List

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]

----
One pass algorithm

1. Create a dummy node, where next is the ll
2. Create copies of this node, first, and second
3. move the first pointer up n + 1
4. move the first pointer to the end, while moving the second pointer, to maintain the space between the two
5. set the second pointer next to next.next
6. return dummy.Next


Time and Space: O(N) N is the number of nodes, O(1)
